Introduction
Objective : In chess, a queen can move as far as she pleases, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A chess board has 8 rows and 8 columns. The standard 8 by 8 Queen’s problem asks how to place 8 queens on an ordinary chess board so that none of them can hit any other in one move.

Algorithm:

Place the queens column wise, start from the left most column
If all queens are placed.
return true and print the solution matrix.
Else
Try all the rows in the current column.
Check if queen can be placed here safely if yes mark the current cell in solution matrix as 1 and try to solve the rest of the prob­lem recursively.
If placing the queen in above step leads to the solution return true.
If placing the queen in above step does not lead to the solution , BACKTRACK, mark the current cell in solution matrix as 0 and return false.
If all the rows are tried and nothing worked, return false and print NO SOLUTION.
